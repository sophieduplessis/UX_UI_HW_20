          specifically targeting heuristic analysis and navigation. This was my
          most exciting project during the Monash UX/UI Bootcamp as halfway
          through the ATO updated their website and a lot of our findings and
          solutions were similar. Come find out what I found and how I solved it

              <p>Without a problem yet I started by creating a user research
                plan, the goal was to look at how users navigate and search for
                information on the ATO website going as broad as possible. I
                interviewed 5 users and found some surprising results which I
                put into and affinity map.</p>

                  Some issues found in user testing included cognitive overload
                  using the global and sub navigation, consistency errors
                  between pages and difficulty using the search function. I then
                  put all of my pain points into a priority matrix. Search
                  functions are an incredibly difficult and complex problem and
                  due to time and financial constraints was deemed to be out of
                  scope.</p>

                            used mobile and desktop navigation but due to
                            reducing complexity of the system it also reduced

                          <p>From user testing I found that the biggest issue
                            facing users was cognitive overload using the main
                            navigation. Using card sorting, IA heuristic
                            analysis and user testing I feel that I was able to
                            create a strong solution that solves the problem I
                            found.

                            During my redesign the ATO also updated their
                            website and did very similar chunking and card
                            sorting with their navigation and IA. Further
                            analysis below.</p>

                            <p>On the original design (1) the cognitive load is
                              too heavy. I feel confident in my IA decisions (2)
                              as ATO redesign has clearly found similar issues
                              as I did during testing and has a similar
                              structure to my redesign (3.) Examples such as
                              chunking down the business and not for profit
                              catagories however their design is less
                              exploratory and now harder to find the information
                              you were looking for due to removing too much
                              context for the labels.
